Vision
The Course Credit Transfer smart contract aims to revolutionize the way educational institutions manage and recognize course credits. By leveraging blockchain technology, this contract provides a secure, transparent, and efficient system for adding courses, registering students, marking course completions, and transferring credits between students. This decentralized approach ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized manipulation, fostering trust between institutions and students.

Flowchart
Institution:

Adds courses with specific credits.
Registers students.
Student:

Completes courses.
Receives credits for completed courses.
Credit Transfer:

Allows credits to be transferred from one student to another upon completion of courses.
The smart contract utilizes mappings to store and manage courses and students efficiently, ensuring only authorized institutions can register courses and students. Events are emitted to record important actions, such as course completions and credit transfers.
